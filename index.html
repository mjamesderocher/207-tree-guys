					<h3>Dangerous and Difficult Tree Removal</h3>
					<p>Some common difficulties of successfully removing a tree includes power lines, improper equipment, dead trees, and of course good ol’ gravity. Successfully removing a tree takes people who are professionally trained and who have knowledge of tree physics, biology, dangerous tools, and the many techniques of cutting. Our employees are properly trained to handle the toughest of situations in tree removal and to make good judgement on what equipment and personnel to use for each project. We remove trees with a powerline-certified climber, and in some situations when the tree is too dead, we will use a bucket truck to ensure the safety of your property and our climbers. There is no tree around to difficult and dangerous for us to remove. We are the true pros in the industry.</p>

					<h3>Pruning</h3>
					<p>Pruning is essential for healthy trees  and for the safety of your home and family. With the right knowledge and equipment, we will prune your trees as necessary to maintain their beauty and health and also to remove any potential hazardous dead branches that can fall on you while you’re working in the lawn or hurt children playing around the trees. There are different levels of pruning, ranging from lite to fine pruning. We will evaluate and explain to you what steps should be taken to benefit you and your trees. You will be left with both your trees and yourself in the very best health possible.</p>
					<p>Many home owners try to prune their own trees and often hurt or hospitalize themselves in the process. Please don’t let that happen to you! Be Smart and call the guys trained for it.</p>

					<h3>Year Round Tree Care</h3>
					<p>There is always a need for tree care, even in the winter. Because of ice and snow accumulation on tree limbs, they tend to break in inconvenient places like driveways, rooftops, and over vehicles. We are here to help maintain your trees from January through December.</p>
					<p>We prune trees in spring and fall months, since pruning a tree in the extreme temperatures of summer and winter months can put a tree in shock and lead to their death. We perform tree removal all year round. Whether it be snowing, raining, hot, or cold, we’re always ready to crank out the saws and get to work.</p>

					<h3>Green Recycling</h3>
					<p>We believe that once tree wastes leave a yard that they should have a second life. When we recycle tree branches, they are taken to a green waste recycling center where they will be processed into compost fertilizer for lawn care. Basically, the trimmings go from your trees to the gardens.</p>
					<p>Large logs are recycled in different ways. Larger logs are sometimes taken to a mill where they will be cut in boards and used for lumber for building homes. Smaller pieces are used for pulp wood which is taken to a paper mill and tuned into the very journals we wright in or papers we read. In other cases, we will process it into firewood which is then sold to our clients, who use wood stoves for heating in the winter season. Pine trees cannot be used for firewood because of the creosol they leave in chimneys can cause house fires, so they are generally recycled into pulp wood, mulch, or plywood. None of the trees we cut go to waste, but are recycled to become beneficial for our daily needs.</p>
